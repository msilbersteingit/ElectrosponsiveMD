This file involves details of a coarse grain simulation. The coarse-grained model is not mapped to a specific chemistry and is a generic model.

Generic forcefields are used for the simulation. Molecular dynamics simulations are carried out on the Stampede2 cluster, and using the open source code LAMMPS.
